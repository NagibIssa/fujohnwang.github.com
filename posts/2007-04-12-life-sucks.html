<p>After walking out of the gate of the company, I got a weird feeling. It's so unreal. It is the read world or it is just a dream. I was so clear that I had came back to the real world, but why such a weird feeling came to me?!</p>
<p>I begun the sleep at 11 o'clock a.m. and was waked up by phone calls from somebody later on.It made the feeling worse. I hate being disturbed very much when I was sleep.The life named &quot;The Rat Race&quot; really sucks.</p>
<p>Dreams came to me last night,many things seemed weird,maybe all of the dreams are weird,who knows?! I couldn't remember the dreams well. It was in class, a Math class, becuase the teacher is my mathematic teacher from my senior middle school, but I was on the campus of my primary school.Although she, my mathematics teacher, was talking to us patiently, I was playing with some high-tech product, with small LCD and other equipments, I just didn't know how to describe it becuase I didn't knwo what it was. When the teacher walked down the platform and came to me , I was still playing with it, so I was caught. The weird thing came again. I rushed out the classroom without any talk to the teacher,I could not tell why.Nothing cares then.</p>
<p>After rushed down the road to our village, the teacher came to my side,but this time the teacher changed to a male one, who was even unfamilliar to me. He bought me a frozen sucker, maybe things like that. We shared it and walked along back to the outside of the campus.He disappeared after leaving me alone there. I rushed into the classrooms and tried to find someone, but none was found, because I even didn't know who was the one I was looking for.I just wandered around, around, and around...</p>
<p>The students rushed out of the classrooms after the class ended. I came across my sister who is my aunt's daughter. She was still a little girl in my dream, but in fact, she had been married 2 years ago. She said she would go home and see her grandma ,and ran away... ...</p>
<p>Blank screen...</p>
<p>I was waked up at 4 o'clock a.m. by the alarm clock this morning.</p>
<p>It was raining...</p>
