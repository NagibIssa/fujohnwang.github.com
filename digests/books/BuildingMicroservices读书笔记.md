# Orchestration VS. Choreography (终于tmd理解了这两个鸟单词在软件行业里的确切意思了...)

With orchestration, we rely on a central brain to guide and drive the process, much like the conductor in an orchestra.

With choreography, we inform each part of the system of its job, and let it work out the details, like dancers all finding their way and reacting to others around them in a ballet.

like 计划经济 VS. 市场经济， the former can be implemented in synchronous RPCs way, and the latter in asynchronous event-driven way.
